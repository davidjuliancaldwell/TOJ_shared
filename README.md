Within the code folder in this repository is the code to 
extract the behavioral and neural data from the TOJ data. 

The data is too large to host on github, so it can be 
downloaded from the following google drive link.

If the "code" and "data" are within the same folder, and MATLAB 
is run from here, it should work.
